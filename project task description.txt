					Overall, this HTML code creates a visually appealing and functional web page resembling the layout of the Disney+ streaming service, allowing users to explore and interact with various movies and TV shows.

					This CSS code defines the styling for the HTML structure provided earlier, which emulates the layout and design of the Disney+ streaming service. Here's a breakdown of the styles:

					1.Global Reset:
					  Resets margin, padding, and box-sizing for all elements to ensure consistent layout across different browsers.
					2.Body Styling:
					  Sets the background color to a dark shade (#0c111b) and defines the font family as Roboto or sans-serif.
					3.Navbar Styling:
					  Styles the navigation bar with a fixed position at the top of the page, utilizing a dark background color.
					  Aligns the brand logo, navigation links, search box, subscribe button, and login link within the navbar.
					4.Carousel Styling:
					  Sets up the carousel container with specific dimensions and positioning.
					  Defines styles for individual slides within the carousel, including background, border radius, and transitions.
					5.Video Card Styling:
					  Arranges video cards in a flex container, ensuring space between each card.
					  Specifies the appearance of each video card, including dimensions, border radius, and overflow behavior.

					  Overall, this CSS code creates a visually appealing and responsive layout for the Disney+ clone, with carefully designed elements such as the navbar, carousel, video cards, and movie lists, ensuring a cohesive and immersive user experience.

					This JavaScript code enhances the functionality of the Disney+ clone webpage by adding dynamic features such as carousel sliding, video playback on hover, and scrolling functionality for card containers. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

					1.Carousel Slider:
					  The createSlide function creates slides dynamically by fetching movie information from the movies array.
					  It creates DOM elements for each slide, including an image and content (title and description).
					  The function sets up the image source and class names for styling.
					  Slides are appended to the carousel container, and their positions are adjusted based on the slide index.
					  The setInterval function periodically calls createSlide to create a sliding effect.
					2.Video Cards:
					  Event listeners are added to each video card to play and pause videos on hover.
					  When a user hovers over a video card, the associated video starts playing, and it pauses when the user moves the cursor away.
					3.Card Sliders:
					  Event listeners are added to the previous and next buttons of each card container.
					  When clicked, these buttons scroll the card container horizontally, allowing users to navigate through a collection of cards.
					  Overall, this JavaScript code adds interactive elements to the Disney+ clone, enhancing user engagement and providing a more immersive browsing experience. Users can now enjoy automatic sliding of content in the carousel, preview videos on hover, and navigate through card collections with ease.

					This JavaScript code defines an array named movies, which contains objects representing different movies. Each movie object has the following properties:

					1.name: The title of the movie.
					2.des: A brief description or summary of the movie.
					3.image: The file path to the image associated with the movie.
					  Here's a breakdown of the movies included in the array:

					1."Falcon and the Winter Soldier":
					   A description of the Marvel series "Falcon and the Winter Soldier."
					   Associated image: 'images/slider 2.PNG'.
					2."Loki":
					   A description of the Marvel series "Loki."
					   Associated image: 'images/slider 1.PNG'.
					3."Wanda Vision":
					   A description of the Marvel series "Wanda Vision."
					   Associated image: 'images/slider 3.PNG'.
					4."Raya and the Last Dragon":
					   A description of the Disney animated movie "Raya and the Last Dragon."
					   Associated image: 'images/slider 4.PNG'.
					5."Luca":
					   A description of the Disney animated movie "Luca."
					   Associated image: 'images/slider 5.PNG'.
					   This array serves as a data source for populating the carousel slider in the web page, providing titles, descriptions, and images for each movie displayed.
